echo React Native recommends installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. 
echo Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:
echo brew install node
echo brew install watchman

echo make sure node installed
echo If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18 or newer.
node -v

echo make sure watchman installed
echo Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. 
echo It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.
watchman -v

echo make sure ruby installed
echo Ruby is an open-source programming language.
echo RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing 
echo Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the 
echo installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.
echo A Ruby gem is a bunch of perfectly packaged Ruby code that gives you access to custom methods somebody else wrote. 
echo Gems just make the process of sharing code much easier.The custom methods inside of gems typically have specific 
echo functionalities. 
ruby -v
rbenv install 2.7.5

echo make sure cocoapods installed so to have pod
echo CocoaPods is one of the dependency management system available for iOS, to manage library dependencies for Xcode projects.
echo CocoaPods is a Ruby gem. You can install CocoaPods using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest version of macOS.
pod --version
echo sudo gem install cocoapods

echo create project octoolboxapp
echo If you previously installed a global react-native-cli package, please remove it as it may cause unexpected issues:

echo Got the following errors while installing bundler
echo Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
echo An error occurred while installing json (2.7.1), and Bundler cannot continue.

echo Refer to How to Fix Ruby Bundle Install Errors
echo https://rollbar.com/blog/ruby-bundle-install-errors/
echo One of the most common causes of bundle install errors is a missing or outdated version of the RubyGems package manager. 
echo RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that is used to manage the installation and updating of 
echo Ruby libraries, also known as gems. If the version of RubyGems is outdated or missing, it may lead to errors when running 
echo bundle install. (Refer to https://guides.rubygems.org for RubyGems. Run gem --help for basic info of running RubyGems.)
echo To fix this issue, we can update RubyGems to the latest version by running the command:
gem update --system
echo Error installing rubygems-update:
echo   There are no versions of rubygems-update (= 3.5.3) compatible with your Ruby & RubyGems
echo 	 rubygems-update requires Ruby version >= 3.0.0. The current ruby version is 2.7.5.203.
echo To list all available versions 
rbenv install --list
echo Install the latest ruby
echo rbenv install 3.2.0
echo To list all local versions.
rbenv install --list-all / -L
echo To choose the Ruby version for your project with, for example, choosing version 3.1.2:
echo cd myproject
echo rbenv local 3.1.2
rbenv local 3.1.2
echo Got 'rbenv: version `3.1.2' not installed'
